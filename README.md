## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- (Optional) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for an integrated development experience.

### Pull the Docker Images

#### Pull the Base Image

```bash
docker pull brakmic/jsdev:latest
```

#### Pull the Extended Image (with Docker Tools)

```bash
docker pull brakmic/jsdev-docker:latest
```

### Running the Containers

#### Running the Base JSDev Container

To start a container using the `jsdev` image:

```bash
docker run -it --name my-jsdev-container brakmic/jsdev:latest
```

This command will launch an interactive bash shell within the container.

#### Running the Extended JSDev Docker Container

To start a container using the `jsdev-docker` image with Docker tools:

```bash
docker run -it --name my-jsdev-docker-container brakmic/jsdev-docker:latest
```

This command will launch an interactive bash shell within the container, with Docker tools installed and configured for the `jsdev` user.

### Using with VS Code Dev Containers

To leverage the full potential of the JSDev Docker images within Visual Studio Code:

1. **Create a `.devcontainer` Directory:**

   In the root of your project, create a `.devcontainer` folder.

2. **Add `devcontainer.json`:**

   Inside `.devcontainer`, create a `devcontainer.json` file with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "JSDev Container",
     "image": "brakmic/jsdev:latest", // Use "brakmic/jsdev-docker:latest" if Docker tools are needed
     "workspaceFolder": "/workspace",
     "workspaceMount": "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind,consistency=cached",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "settings": {
           "files.exclude": {
             "**/.git": true,
             "**/.DS_Store": true
           }
         }
       }
     },
     "mounts": [
       "source=${localWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/setup-workspace.mjs,target=/workspace/.devcontainer/setup-workspace.mjs,type=bind"
     ],
     "postCreateCommand": "node /workspace/.devcontainer/setup-workspace.mjs && ln -sf /workspace/dev.code-workspace /home/jsdev/.vscode-server/dev.code-workspace",
     "remoteUser": "jsdev"
   }
   ```

   - **Note:** If you intend to use Docker tools within the Dev Container, update the `"image"` field to `"brakmic/jsdev-docker:latest"`.

3. **Add Setup Scripts:**

   Place any necessary setup scripts (e.g., `setup-workspace.mjs`) inside the `.devcontainer` directory.

4. **Open in VS Code:**

   Open your project in VS Code. You should see a prompt to reopen the project in a Dev Container. Confirm to start using the JSDev environment.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the Dockerfiles or the `devcontainer.json` to suit your specific development needs. Whether it's adding new global packages, configuring additional tools, or adjusting user settings, JSDev is designed to be flexible and adaptable.
